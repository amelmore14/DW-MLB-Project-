#### Data Wrangling Project Report: MLB Player Performance Analysis  

### Introduction  

Statistics play a crucial role in analyzing player performance, especially in professional 
sports like baseball. While the performance metrics of seasoned athletes are carefully 
tracked, many fans may not fully appreciate the various factors that influence these 
numbers. IN this project, I explore the relationship between MLB player hitting statistics 
and key variables, including years of experience in the league, position, and playing time. 
By leveraging fata from RotoWire and ESPN.com, I investigate how these factors contribute 
to variations in player performance.  

### Data Sources   
RotoWire:  
The first dataset comes from RotoWire, a platform that aggregates MLB player statistics for 
fantasy baseball purposes. It provides a comprehensive range of hitting statistics for all 
MLB players during that 2024 regular season. I downloaded the data in CSV format and 
imported it into my Python notebook. To prepare the data for analysis, I removed 
unnecessary columns and ensured that all data types were correctly formatted.  

ESPN.com:  
Additionally, I scraped data from ESPN.com, the official source of real-time player 
information and historical performance data. This allowed me to gather details on players’ 
years of experience in the league, as well as other relevant features for my analysis.  

Combining Sources:  
To ensure a comprehensive analysis, I combined the RotoWire and ESPN datasets. Since 
there is overlap in the information from both sources, I standardized the structure of the 
data frames before merging them on player names. This ensured that I had a unified datast 
for analysis.  

Below is my up to date data dictionary showing the column names, type and description of 
the variables used in my analysis.

Analysis  
1. Player Experience vs. Batting Average and Home Runs  
I wanted to investigate whether years of experience in the MLB affect a player’s 
batting average and home run production. To do this, I created scatterplots to 
visualize the relationship between years of experience and both statistics 
    • Batting Average vs. Years of Experience 
    In Figure 1, the scatterplot reveals that years of experience do not have a 
    clear impact on batting average. This was surprising, as I expected that more 
    experienced players would have higher batting averages. However, further 
    research suggests that factors such as age, skill development, and natural 
    decline over time might influence batting average more significantly than 
    experience alone. Older players, for example, often experience a decline in 
    performance, which could contribute to this observation 
    • Home Runs vs. Years of Experience 
    Similarly, Figure 2 shows no strong correlation between years of experience 
    and home run production. While I initially assumed that more experienced 
    players would hit more home runs, the reality is that a player's role in the 
    lineup is a more significant factor. Not all players are home run hitters; roles 
    vary from speedsters and contact hitters to power hitters. This is why years of 
    experience doesn't necessarily predict home run totals.

    2. Player Performance Metrics by Position  
    Next, I examined how player performance varies by position on the field. Different 
    positions demand different skill sets, and this can influence performance metrics 
    like batting average and home runs. I calculated the mean values for several 
    performance metrics, including batting average, home runs, slugging percentage, 
    on-base percentage, OPS (on-base plus slugging), runs, and hits. 
    • Batting Average by Position 
    In Figure 3, we see that the Designated Hitter (DH) has the highest batting 
    average, which aligns with expectations. The DH is typically one of the best 
    hitters on the team, and their primary role is to provide offensive production 
    • Home Runs by Position 
    In Figure 4, the DH also leads in home runs, with first basemen coming in 
    second. This is consistent with the profile of a first baseman, who is often a 
    power hitter with a strong build. Power hitting is a key part of their role in the 
    lineup, which is reflected in the higher home run totals

    3. Playing Time v. Batting Average and On Base Percentage  
    Finally, I explored how playing time, measured by the number of games played, 
    affects a player's batting average and on-base percentage. Intuitively, it makes 
    sense that as players accumulate more game experience, they would improve their 
    performance. 
    • Batting Average vs. Games Played 
    In Figure 5, the scatterplot shows a slight positive trend between the number 
    of games played and batting average. Players who spend more time on the 
    field tend to improve their batting consistency over time, as they gain more 
    experience and confidence. 
    • On-Base Percentage vs. Games Played 
    Figure 6 shows a similar trend, where the on-base percentage improves with 
    the number of games played. This likely reflects players' increasing familiarity 
    with opposing pitchers and their ability to adjust over the course of a season.

### Conclusion  
In this project, I analyzed the impact of several key factors on player performance in Major 
League Baseball (MLB) during the 2024 season, focusing on player experience, position, 
and playing time. The main findings are as follows: 

1. How does player experience (years in MLB) affect batting average and home run 
production?  
a. Years of experience in the MLB did not appear to significantly affect a player's 
batting average or home run totals. This suggests that other factors, such as 
age, role in the lineup, and individual skill development, play a more 
important role in determining these metrics 
 
2. How do player performance metrics vary by position?  
a. Designated hitters and first basemen generally had the highest home run 
totals, with the DH also leading in batting average (.258). This reflects the 
different roles players occupy within a team, with power hitters (such as DHs 
and first basemen) naturally excelling in these categories. 
 
3. What is the effect of playing time on players batting average and on base percentage 
a. There was a positive relationship between the number of games played and 
both batting average and on-base percentage. This indicates that players 
tend to improve over time as they gain more experience and settle into a 
rhythm throughout the season. 
 
While the analysis provides valuable insights, there were several limitations to consider. 
Key factors, such as player age and injury history, were not included in the analysis, and 
these can significantly influence a player's performance. Additionally, the scope of the 
project was limited to the 2024 season, and trends observed in this year may not 
necessarily apply to other seasons due to changes in player talent, performance, and 
external factors.  

### Future Work 
For further analysis, expanding the dataset to include multiple seasons and additional 
variables (such as player age, injuries, and advanced performance metrics like WAR) would 
provide a more comprehensive understanding of the factors that influence player 
performance in MLB.
