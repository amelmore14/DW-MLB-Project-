# 3250 Data Wrangling MLB Project

## Description

This project is taking data from two Major Leauge Baseball cites and combining them into one singular dataframe. Whith this dataframe my goal was to understand how Years, Games Played, and Position effected Batting Average, Home Runs and On Base Percentage.

Each player has a different role on each different team. Many players are traded each year to new teams where they have to take on the new role they were given. My interest in this sparked by my boyfriend currently playing baseball at a D1 level with hopes of being drafted in the next two years. With his in debth knowledge of the game and what happens behind closed doors, I was really able to understand the data.

## Instructions

In my Data folder I have the links to both of my data sources. The first one being the downloaded data and the second one being the scraped data.

In the Notebooks folder I have a readme file that talks about what is in the folder. There you can find both notebooks, the first being only the scraped data from my second source and the second being the notebook holding the remainder of my code.

In the Results folder you can find my Final Report.
